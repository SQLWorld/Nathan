<title><h1>My Mom!</h1></title>
<p>This is about my Mom. She is a hard worker. She gets up every day at 5:00 just to make breakfast. 
    My mom's favorite athlete is Kobe Bryant.(RIP Kobe. We miss you)She is a great cook. That is great
    because my dad can not cook. Some foods she makes are injera,hot dogs,Chicken nuggets and more.
